# Parallel-and-Sequential-Data-Preprocessing of climate data
This project implements efficient data preprocessing techniques for large-scale datasets. It compares sequential processing with parallel computing methods to highlight performance differences and showcase how parallelism can significantly reduce processing time.

Project Structure

- Sequential Processing: Processes the entire dataset in a single thread.

- Parallel Processing:

  - multiprocessing for CPU-based parallelism.

  - Dask for distributed and parallel data handling.

Requirements

To run the code, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

**!pip install pandas numpy dask**
